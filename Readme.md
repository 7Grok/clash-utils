# Clash utils

A random collection of reusable [Clash](http://www.clash-lang.org/) designs/examples.

## Includes:
* Binary to BCD conversion
* CORDIC for calculating trigonometric functions
* CRC calculation
* A FIFO
* FIR, IIR filters
* A bitonic sorting network
* Divider
* FFTs
* Gray code conversion
* Hamming code encoding/decoding
* LFSRs
* Pseudo LRU trees

## Features:

Haddock documentation and QuickCheck tests.

## Status

Most of these designs are not FPGA proven (yet). Designs that have actually been tested on an FPGA are:
* the CRCs
* the FIFOs
